# Stamp Calculator

## About this project
This project is to create a small program that will take a collection of stamp with their values, and will calculate which stamps you should use to get as close to the given postage as possible without going under.

## Why?
In short, because my mom add a huge, random assortment of different stamps and could not figure out the best way to combine them to get proper postage.

## How to run it
This currently needs to be run using node. It was written and tested on node v16.17.1. There is currently no ui for this program.

## To-do
- More rigorous testing
- Add functionality to select for more parameters, i.e., tell it to use the most stamps or the fewest.
- Add a UI.
